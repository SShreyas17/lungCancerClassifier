# lungCancerClassifier
This project develops an AI-based lung cancer detection system using CT scan images. A preprocessing pipeline segments lung regions and nodules, while a CNN model classifies images. A Tkinter GUI with DenseNet201 and ResNet50 ensemble provides real-time predictions across four lung cancer categories.
